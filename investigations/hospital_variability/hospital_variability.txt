Justification:
We used data from the "Timely and Effective Care" data set in order to evaluate how procedure scores varied across hospitals for the individual procedures. We felt taht this data provided the most structured and objective data regarding procedure quality, as opposed to the complications data set which provided a higher-level view of quality by provide records for negative outcomes.  We used the oput of standard deviation in order to rank the top ten procedures in terms of the highest variation across hospitals.
